# Library - cppProj

This repository is used for a project I'm currently doing as my university homework assignment.

# Project status

The project is currently in it's alpha testing phase, with all necessary user and admin features working to their finest extent. It allows for safe use (no crashes as of today).
In it's current status, all of the user input is limited and checked properly for mistakes during said input in order to prevent bugs in the following phases of project development.
The project may be used as a just cause tool for a smaller library - having to stay turned on all the time because of the lack of a database (data is temporary and lives while the .exe is active).


# Following features

Most of these features will be included in a new, separate branch in order to always keep the project core untouched.

1. Add database,
2. Improve upon existing features,
3. Structure the bin (libProj) to overcome some scope issues,
4. Change the current class system implementation to contain more user methods instead of user features or rather separate functions (for those which are capable of being implemented in such fashion).

Stay tuned for more!
